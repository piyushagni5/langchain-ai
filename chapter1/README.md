# Chapter 1 - The LangChain Fundamentals

This directory contains the code and notebooks for **Chapter 1** of the *Generative AI using LangChain* series.

In this chapter, we lay the foundation for understanding how to build generative AI applications using LangChain. We explore core concepts like language models, prompt engineering, output parsing, chains, and memory — all essential building blocks for modern LLM applications.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Before running the notebooks, make sure you’ve set up your environment using **pip**, **conda**, **Poetry**, or **Docker**.

> **API Keys Required**  
Some examples use services like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini. Be sure to configure your API keys securely using a `.env` file or environment variables.  
Refer to the main [Environment Setup Guide](../README.md) for more details.
